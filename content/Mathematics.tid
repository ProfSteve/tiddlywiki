There are several ways to incorporate mathematical formulae into ~TiddlyWiki and use ~LaTeX in tiddlers:
# The latest solution is [[TwFormulaPlugin|https://github.com/YakovL/TiddlyWiki_TwFormulaPlugin/]], allowing to use ~KaTeX and other libraries like ~MathJax, and ~MathQuill.
# It's worth mentioning some of its predecessors: [[PluginMathJax|http://math-template.tiddlyspace.com/#%5B%5BPluginMathJax%20v1.3%5D%5D]], [[TiddlyJsMath|http://bob.mcelrath.org/tiddlyjsmath.html]], and [[MathSVGPlugin|https://web.archive.org/web/20130707161357/http://www.math.ist.utl.pt/~psoares/mathsvg.html]]; but it's unlikely that you'll need them.

An alternative is to use a service like [[CodeCogs|http://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php]] that enables you to generate images of equations from ~LaTeX source that can be manually inserted into ~TiddlyWiki. Some examples of this technique are https://twmath.tiddlyspot.com and https://twequation.tiddlyspot.com
